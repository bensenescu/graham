/**
 * Fractional indexing utilities for ordering Q&A blocks.
 *
 * Sort keys are strings that can be compared lexicographically to determine order.
 * The list is sorted in DESCENDING order, meaning:
 * - Higher sort keys appear at the TOP of the list
 * - Lower sort keys appear at the BOTTOM of the list
 *
 * Key generation strategies:
 * - New blocks: timestamp-based keys (ensures newer = higher = appears at top)
 * - Insert before a key: prepend "!" (always lexicographically smaller)
 * - Insert after a key: append "~" (always lexicographically greater)
 * - Insert between two keys: find midpoint or extend with middle char
